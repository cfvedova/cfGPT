1. lr modifications
    a. path seems blocked:
        i. reason: Stabilization around 0.4 happens when lr is 0.01, regardless of lr. It only changes per epoch. In first epoch, it already stabilizes
2. Disable Adam
    a. path blocked:
        i. Same reason as above
3. AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)- changes precision for different tasks (ie. int/float16/etc.) - could be messing with performance with new type
4. Freeze model parameters more correctly
5. Get some data output to see Ali's advice
    a. Likely will be nonsensical output
6. More data?
7. More precise generation of data?
    a. Look at Scaden
8. Deep Dive into Scaden topics
    a. Look at MSE info, etc.
    b. Create spreadsheet to compare differences between Scaden and our model
        i. List reasons for these differences
9. Want to get Bulk dataset to get actual testable results
