1. lr modifications
    a. path seems blocked:
        i. reason: Stabilization around 0.4 happens when lr is 0.01, regardless of lr. It only changes per epoch. In first epoch, it already stabilizes
2. Disable Adam
    a. path blocked:
        i. Same reason as above
3. AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)- changes precision for different tasks (ie. int/float16/etc.) - could be messing with performance with new type
    a. Doubles time per batch with no real gain so far
4. Freeze model parameters more correctly
5. Get some data output to see Ali's advice
    a. Likely will be nonsensical output
6. More data?
7. More precise generation of data?
    a. Look at Scaden
8. Deep Dive into Scaden topics
    a. Look at MSE info, etc.
    b. Create spreadsheet to compare differences between Scaden and our model
        i. List reasons for these differences
9. Want to get Bulk dataset to get actual testable results
10. Loss Function
    a. RMSE?
11. Too many params?
    i: Loading params encoder.embedding.weight with shape torch.Size([60697, 512])
    3000 length for input
    a. This may cause model to underfit
    b. Balance of capacity vs. constrainment
    c. underfit vs. overfit
    d. try with max_seq_len to 18000
12. Tabula Sapiens sc data is poor?
    a. few shot celltypes
    b. Condense celltypes
    c. redundant celltypes
13. Scaling sampling?
14. Fast-attention

1. Have higher max seq len
A: Impossible due to space constraints

2. Simulate only with hvg (highly variable genes, pre simulation)
A: Seems to be promising. Loss is actually learning

3. Clean up Tabula Sapiens data
A: 

Important
1. Preprocessing that Scaden does:
    a. Filter for cells with less than 500 genes
2. Create biased simulated samples
    a. sparse samples


Steps:
0. Run on simplified Tabula
    a. Fails. Could be some mal interaction or bug
    b. One possibility:
        i . Only 63 cells now. So, could be an issue with not having the sparse samples
    c. Explore the hvg calculation

1. Test script
    a. Plot for our sample
        i. Pie chart of cell types
        ii. Predicted numbers
    b. Get results for actual bulk data
        a. Bulk data test
Run the above

2. Generate like Scaden
    Might be causing issue with simplified Tabula



1. Test with DEGs instead of HVGs
    a. With non-trimmed
2. Test on huge dataset


1. label hvg broken?
2. sparse samples
3. degs?
